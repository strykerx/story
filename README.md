There was a kingdom with an old but benevolent, kind and all-around amazing king and queen. They were compassionate and loved the kingdom....even if the houses didn't love each other. There was always a feud going on between the houses, but just the presence of the king and queen kept them in line.
The captain of the guard, protag, loved the king and queen and they treated her like their own child.
However, after decades of peaceful reigning, the king took ill due to old age and one dark night, he passed away. The only people at his bedside were the queen and his trusted captain of the guard, protag.
The kingdoms succession rules stated that the after the king's death, crown then goes to the Queen. So preparations were made to make the Queen the new ruler.
The kingdom prided itself on its horses. So the coronation ceremony traditionally took place at a huge stage with giant stable doors. The next heir walked through the mammoth doors as the new ruler to be greeted by the throngs of cheering constituents in the stands on the other side. Then, as is tradition, a parade of horses come galloping out behind the new heir, creating a circle around them.
The queen's coronation was truly a sight to behold, as there hadn't been a coronation in 60 years. She was crowned to much fanfare. But alas, with the loss of her husband, the queen couldn't go on and died a few weeks later of a broken heart. 
The rules of succession then state that the crown goes to the eldest son. The king and queen had 5 children. One married off to each of the houses when they became of age. Their eldest son, Grimhold, was not the eldest child. That role fell to his older sister, Razel. But as Grimhold was the eldest son, he was to be made king. He was a pompous brat. He and his snooty wife eagerly grabbed at the throne. 
The coronation ceremony was once again prepared. But once he exited the monstrous stable doors to accept his crown, he was met with the blade of Razel, his older sister, who swooped in from the sky, dressed in black. She hated the traditional misogynistic succession rules and thought that as the eldest child, she deserved the crown. And now, with her brother murdered at her hand, the rules of succession did say that it goes to the eldest child, regardless of sex. 

It would have been convenient to do the coronation right then, but because the whole commotion of her murdering her brother sent all the guests running and the horses fleeing, her coronation was set up for the following week. Razel was a vile person, who loved the suffering of others. The protag was not happy to be serving under her.
Well the day of Razel's coronation came. The monumental stable doors opened and she stepped out, the crowd went mild. They all knew how wicked she was. 
The parade of horses came galloping out, but there was a figure on the back of one of the horses. It was the third oldest, Daniella. She was brave, kind, benevolent and absolutely adored by the whole kingdom. She was also one of the most talented swords people in the kingdom. The crowd erupted in cheers upon seeing her, dashing out, blade drawn, ready to take the throne away from her evil sister. 
But Razel was prepared for the assassination attempt and drew a crossbow from her cloak. She fired and hit Daniella right in the chest. But the noble sister wouldn't go down so easily. She leapt off the horse and slashed at her sister with her shimmering blade, leaving a gaping stripe down Razel's middle. Sadly, the blow wasn't fatal. The evil sister then took a knife out and jabbed it through the eye of Daniella, killing her instantly.
Nevertheless, The evil Razel's reign didn't last long, as the gash she received, while normally not life threatening, became infected. This could be due to the fact that none of the healers particularly liked her. She passed away a couple weeks later.
This meant, with 4 of the children dead, the crown would go to the baby boy of the family. A young timid man named Paul. Paul had always pushed himself away from the royalty. 
The protag went to his chateau to tell him the news of his sister's death, only to discover that he had already received the news. She found his body hanging from a noose, with a note saying that he would rather die than take up the weight of the kingdom.
With no other children. The protag was really worried. Tensions between houses were elevated beyond belief with the instability of the monarchy. She needed to find a ruler. The rules of succession stated that the crown should go to the next living kin. This just happened to be the king's nephew, Donaphan, or Donny for short. Not only was Donny the king's next living kin, he was also the king's last living kin. Donny was somewhat dimwitted young man that had been living in a summer home by the beach. Living off his uncle's dime, he had not had to work a day in his life. He didn't have a care or responsibility in the world.
Donny wasn't a bad person, nor was he snobby or snooty. Just a little daft and lazy.
Well the protag found him. He didn't want to leave his nice relaxing life. But she was able to convince him.
The day of Donny's coronation arrived. The protag had guards posted all over to prevent any assassination attempts. The crowd was rumbling unsettling in their seats.
The protag was waiting with the priest, behind the gigantic stable doors for the nephew to show up. A line of horses bordered the path from the castle to the backstage of the giant door. The protag and priest were getting worried. Donny should have arrived by now. Just as the protag was about to go find him, he appeared dressed in a robe that was 2 sizes too big for him. He lankilly stepped down the path. He waved to the protag. He had taken a liking to her. 
"Look at these horses" he said admiring them as he walked down the path. "They're so strong and muscular". He circled one, admiring it and started walking off the path, behind the line of horses.
"Protag, have you seen these horses? Magnificent!" The protag and priest started yelling at the king-to-be to stop walking behind the horses, because anyone who has been around horses knows that you don't do that.
The nephew took their waving as excitement for the horses, so he raised his hands too and slapped one of the horses butts.
In .27 seconds flat the horses hoof went from resting on the ground to directly in the center of the nephews chest. He flew backwards a minimum of 15 feet, where he laid motionless.
The protag and priest ran to Donny, only to find him dead. Dead dead dead. His chest was crushed in.
The protag really started freaking out. She didn't know what to do. She was in charge of keeping the peace and the houses would for sure start warring with no clear heir to the throne. 
Should she try and puppet the body and make it seem like he was ok and then just keep his death secret until they figure out what to do? 
Should she disguise herself as him?
Should she go out there and try claiming the throne as her own?
Should she go out and try to break the news to the hoard of people gently?
She pondered and deliberated and finally decided what she wanted to do.
The crowds were rustling in their seats, unnerved that the stable doors hadn't opened. One of the crowd screamed, they're opening!
The crowd drew silent as the doors opened, anticipating their new king. 
No one expected what emerged from the doors. Out burst a black knight on horseback. So black it seemed the darkness was oozing off them. They had the body of the king-to-be on the back of the horse.
"I am the Raven Knight!" The knight rumbled. "And I have kidnapped your precious king!"
With that, the raven knight galloped away.

Once the raven knight felt like they had gotten far enough away, they removed their helmet, and started wiping down all the gross black mud the protag had put all over herself to make her armor look black.
She had decided that the next best thing from a unifying ruler to hold the kingdom together, was a unifying enemy.
